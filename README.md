# AeroTech: A Sensor-Based Aeroponics System for Efficient Vegetable Growth

AeroTech is an automated, sensor-driven aeroponics system designed to enhance vegetable farming efficiency through real-time monitoring, adaptive climate control, and remote data access. Powered by solar energy, AeroTech aims to provide a sustainable and intelligent solution for soilless agriculture.

## Features

- Sensor Monitoring: Real-time tracking of:

  - pH Level
  - Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
  - Water Level
  - Temperature

- Automation:

  - Microcontroller-controlled pumps and fans
  - Adaptive environmental regulation based on sensor data

- Remote Access & Alerts:

  - SMS notifications for anomalies (e.g., pump failure, pH imbalance)
  - Cloud dashboard for live data logging, visualization, and historical analytics

- Sustainable Power:

  - Solar energy integration with battery backup
  - Optimized for energy efficiency in remote or off-grid locations

- Performance Assessment:
  - Compared against traditional soil-based farming in terms of:
    - Resource efficiency
    - Growth rate
    - Nutrient usage
